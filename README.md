Unlike other services, wallabag is free and open source.  
wallabag for Android is a companion app for [wallabag](https://www.wallabag.org). You need a wallabag account first, which you are going to use in this app.

## Legacy Versions of the App

We have two legacy branches, where old versions of this app can be found. Those old versions of the app are not distributed via F-Droid or Google Play. For some releases you can find a compiled version of the app, e.g. for [version 2.2.0](https://github.com/wallabag/android-app/releases/tag/2.2.0). Of course you can build a legacy version from the source. 

### Branch legacy

The [legacy](https://github.com/wallabag/android-app/tree/legacy) branch was started to keep a version, which supports wallabag server version 1.x. This branch is not maintained anymore.

### Branch legacy-older-android-5.0

The branch [legacy-older-android-5.0](https://github.com/wallabag/android-app/tree/legacy-older-android-5.0) has been started on 2019-03-06. It keeps a version of the application, which still supports Android versions below 5.0 Lollipop.

The dependency (okhttp 3.13.x++) we use in this app forced us to upgrade the API level of the app to Android 5.0 as a minimum. That is what can be found in the master branch. According to the [okhttp Readme](https://github.com/square/okhttp#requirements), the okhttp team "will backport critical fixes to the 3.12.x branch through December 31, 2020."
